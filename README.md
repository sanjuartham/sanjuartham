## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me:
Iâ€™m Sanjuktha Artham and Iâ€™m a third year college student at UC San Diego passionate about the bridge between business and technology and learning new things! 

My major in Cognitive Science, with a focus on Machine Learning and Neural Computation, blends the technical world with an understanding of how people think and behave. Unlike conventional Computer Science and Business degrees, this unique combination lets me approach technology from a human perspective, applying insights to areas like artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

Alongside this, my minor in Technology, Innovation, and Supply Chain has given me solid skills in project management, business operations, and sustainability. Itâ€™s a perfect match for the growing demand in tech-driven fields like data science, data analytics and artificial intelligence.
